# V3SaveManager

A CLI save editor for the game "Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony".
NOT USER-FRIENDLY!
You'll need to compile it every time you want to edit something.
If you just run it without changing anything, it won't do anything.
...For now, at least.
Contributions and bug/issue-reporting are welcome and appreciated.

# Compatibility

This program was only tested with the "legacy" Steam PC version of the game.
IT *MAY OR MAY NOT* WORK WITH THE V3 ANNIVERSARY EDITION SAVEFILES.

# How-to-use

Don't edit/use this program unless you know what you're doing, as your save files may corrupt. You have been warned.
We are not responsible and/or liable for any damage, and we won't help you recover your savefiles. Make backups frequently.
After making the changes you desire in the "Program.cs" file, and compiling the program, run the program with the savefile as the first argument.
A new file called "mysave.dat" will be created, possibly in the same folder as the savefile you used as an argument.
Move and rename the file, if needed.

## Why it's called "save manager" instead of "save editor"?
The name was chosen early on in development (May/June 2022), but there are currently no features planned other than save editing.
